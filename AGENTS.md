You need to write telegram inline bot for downloading music. All download workarounds are in workaround*.py
use namingLikeThis for files, commits and PRs
checkout to example branch to see an example of telegram inline bot. The structure of project must be the same - docker, docker compose, gh ci/cd, the same libs, etc
don't be afraid to copy-paste from example - it's ok
all code and comments must be in english, but all the UI must be in Russian primary, and if you want, english
